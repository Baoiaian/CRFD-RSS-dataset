## Overview
This project presents an innovative fire detection system, termed Cross-Regional Fire Detection (CRFD), utilizing Wireless Sensing Technology. Unlike traditional fire detection methods that rely on temperature sensors or cameras and are limited to specific areas, CRFD leverages changes in Received Signal Strengths (RSS) from wireless signals to detect fires, even across obstructions like walls. This method addresses limitations of existing systems by providing early warnings and enabling fire detection in non-line-of-sight scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Non-Line-of-Sight Detection**: Detects fires through walls by monitoring changes in wireless signal strength.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves a success rate of over 95.78% in identifying fire events.
- **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes existing wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi) without needing additional equipment.
- **Early Warning System**: Alerts residents in adjacent rooms or apartments, especially beneficial during nighttime.

## How It Works
- **Signal Strength Monitoring**: Fires cause temperature changes affecting the resistance in wireless transceivers, which in turn affects RSS.
- **Smoke Detection**: Presence of smoke and particulate matter alters wireless signals through refraction and reflection.
- **RSS Analysis**: The system extracts RSS characteristics under fire and no-fire conditions to determine the occurrence of a fire.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes both time-domain and frequency-domain features of RSS data for accurate classification and detection.

## Experimental Setup and Results
- **Scenarios**: Experiments conducted in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight environments.
- **Performance**: Demonstrated high accuracy in real fire scenarios, reducing false alarms and improving practical applicability.

## Advantages Over Traditional Methods
- **Wide Coverage**: Can detect fires outside of specific monitored zones.
- **Lower Costs**: Eliminates the need for specialized equipment and reduces installation costs.
- **Privacy Protection**: Does not rely on video-based solutions, thus addressing privacy concerns.

## System Architecture
- **Propagation Mechanisms**: Details on how wireless signals interact with obstacles, including penetration, diffraction, reflection, and scattering.
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis**: Examines how fire-induced smoke particles affect signal frequency distribution.
- **Temperature Effects**: Explores how rising temperatures from fires impact the physical properties of semiconductor materials in wireless transceivers.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The CRFD system offers a novel, efficient, and economical solution for fire detection, with the potential for widespread adoption in urban environments. Future research will focus on enhancing detection algorithms and expanding the system's capabilities in various environmental conditions.
